# Summary

This is the Camplight LLM pair coding task. You and the interviewer are going to work together on it to implement an LLM-enabled system.

# Preparation

1. If you use VSCode: install LiveShare plugin
2. IF you use another IDE: install https://mob.sh/

The intention is to work in a true pair-programming manner.

# Goals

1. Create an application that enhances text input using an LLM similar to grammarly. It should receive some text and fix grammar and style issues in it.
2. Add caching, so we can reduce the calls to the LLM.
3. Implement a queue-based interface for the text-enhancement logic.
